      <li>In a web browser, navigate to your Beacon app.</li>
      <li>Start playback for an episode or movie.</li>
      <li><p>Right click in the player and select <strong>Player Information</strong>.</p>

    <p>You are no longer limited to just using the default player in your account for Beacon web apps. You can create one or more configurable players in your account. Contact the OTT Delivery Team to associate a specific player ID with your app.</p>
    <p>Here is an example of how you can create multiple players for use across one app:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>One player for live previews in beacon</li>
      <li>One player for live players in beacon</li>
      <li>One player for VOD players in beacon</li>
    </ul>
