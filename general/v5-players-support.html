    <!-- <p>V5 players will not be displayed in the new Marketing Studio UI but will still be visible in the standard Video Cloud Studio UI. However, editing or updating these v5 players using Video Cloud Studio is not supported.</p> -->
    <p>The one exception will be the <strong>Brightcove Default Player</strong> (the player that every account comes with). You can delete this player through the Players module in Video Cloud Studio, and our Brightcove System will automatically generate a new Brightcove Default Player with the latest version.</p>
    <p>If you want to know if your account still contains V5 players, you can use the <a href="https://apis.support.brightcove.com/player-management/code-samples/player-management-api-sample-display-players.html">Display Players</a> sample app.</p>
    <p>It is still possible to update the player version using the Player Management API or, with this sample app, <a href="https://apis.support.brightcove.com/player-management/code-samples/player-managment-api-update-player-version.html">Update Player Version</a>. The v5 players in production (and their embed codes) will continue working as expected.</p>
    <p>We highly recommend contacting <a href="https://supportportal.brightcove.com/s/login/?language=en_US&ec=302&startURL=%2Fs%2F">Brightcove Support</a> for guidance if you have any doubts or concerns about your embedded v5 players.</p>
