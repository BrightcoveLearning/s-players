    <p>Version 5 players will no longer be supported within Video Cloud Studio and will not be displayed within the UI. These players will still playback content and are embeddable. However, editing or updating these players using Video Cloud Studio will not be possible.</p>
    <p>The one exception will be the <strong>Brightcove Default Player</strong> (the player that every account comes with). You can delete this player through the Players module in Video Cloud Studio, and our Brightcove System will automatically generate a new Brightcove Default Player with the latest version.</p>
    <p>If you want to know if your account still contains version 5 players, you can use the <a href="https://apis.support.brightcove.com/player-management/code-samples/player-management-api-sample-display-players.html">Display Players</a> sample app.</p>
    <p>It is still possible to update the player version using the Player Management API or, with this sample app, <a href="https://apis.support.brightcove.com/player-management/code-samples/player-managment-api-update-player-version.html">Update Player Version</a>. However, you will not be able to publish a player that still got a 5 version using this API. The version 5 players in production (and their embed codes) will continue working as expected.</p>
    <p>We highly recommend deleting the players with version 5 and creating new players to avoid confusion.</p>
